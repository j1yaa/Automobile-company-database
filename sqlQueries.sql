-- 1. Show sales trends for various brands over the past 3 years, by year, month,week.
-- Then break these data out by gender of the buyer and then by income range.

-- Income in this qury is broken down into high, medium and low income.
-- High Income- 60k+
-- Medium Income- 30k-60k
-- Low Income - <30k

-- Yearly trend
-- Groups data by year, starting at the oldest 2022. The data is then ordered by the demographic which purchased the most cars that year.
